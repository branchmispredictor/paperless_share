An Android app that bridges your document scanner with your [paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) server.

## Why?

I like using extremely refined scanning apps such as [Office Lens](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&hl=en_US&gl=US) for documents. **Paperless Share** adds Paperless to the Android share sheet for easy consumption.

It's similar in spirit to [TripleCamel](https://github.com/ebaschiera/TripleCamel), an app that does its job well and can be hidden from your launcher's app list.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This app built for [paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) version 0.9.5 or higher.

### Android
